snippet-copier
==============

This is a fork of Jeff Wheeler's script to convert Textmate
snippets to YASnippet snippets (for use in Emacs).  I cloned from
his Git repo here:

http://code.nokrev.com/?p=snippet-copier.git;a=summary
git://code.nokrev.com:6002/snippet-copier.git

Added Features
==============

I have added the following new features:

* Ability to use an arbitrary SVN url as the source.  The script originally
  only download from MacroMates's SVN though with the convenience of only
  having having to specify the bundle name.  You can still do that, but now
  you can instead specify the URL of a Textmate bundle with the --url option.

* Ability to use a downloaded Textmate bundle as the source (using the
  --folder option)
  
Example
=======

An example usage of specifying an SVN repository as the source (in this
case an Oracle PL/SQL bundle used in plsql-mode):

snippet_copier.py \
 --url http://oracle-textmate-bundle.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Oracle.tmbundle/ \
 --path ~/Emacs/snippets/text-mode/plsql-mode

Note that currently the URL specified should have a trailing slash
("Bundle/" is appended to it).

To use a downloaded bundle:

snippet_copier.py \
 --folder ~/Downloads/Oracle.tmbundle \
 --path ~/Emacs/snippets/text-mode/plsql-mode
