snippet-copier
==============

This is a fork of Jeff Wheeler's script to convert Textmate
snippets to YASnippet snippets (for use in Emacs).  I cloned from
his Git repo here:

http://code.nokrev.com/?p=snippet-copier.git;a=summary
git://code.nokrev.com:6002/snippet-copier.git

Added Features
==============

I have added the following new features:

* Ability to use an arbitrary SVN url as the source.  The script
  originally only download from http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/
  though with the convenience of only having having to specify the
  bundle name.  You can still do that, but now you can instead specify
  the URL of a Textmate bundle with the --url option.

TODO
====

I plan to add these features:

* Ability to use a downloaded Textmate bundle as the source

Example
=======

An example usage of specifying an SVN repository as the source (in this
case an Oracle PL/SQL bundle used in plsql-mode):

snippet_copier.py \
 --url http://oracle-textmate-bundle.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Oracle.tmbundle/ \
 --path ~/Emacs/snippets/text-mode/plsql-mode

Note that currently the URL specified should have a trailing slash
("Bundle/" is appended to it).
